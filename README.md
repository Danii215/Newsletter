## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

Working with React and Next, using Zod, and a bit of Framer Motion, even though there are no code related to Framer Motion in this final version.

### Continued development

I wish to refine my React + Next skills, aswell as TypeScript.
